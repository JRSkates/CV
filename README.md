## Jack Skates

Iâ€™m Jack, a recent graduate of [Maker's Academy](https://apply.makers.tech/tech-skills-bootcamp-in-software-engineering) tech bootcamp. I'm an aspiring developer with experience in developing web and mobile apps using primarily the MERN stack, React Native and Ruby, however I consider myself "language agnostic" and I'm keen to continuing my learning in Python and other languages. I love to work in teams and build exciting, forward thinking and interesting projects with cutting edge tech. I also have a very strong interest in all things AI. 

Before Makers, I had a variety of roles: I spent 5 years as a crutial team member in a SaaS online platfrom for creatives called Music Gateway. I served a number of roles during my career, most notable of which was Head of A&R where I led a team to spearhead the acquisition of Artists and Labels under our catalogue. I also worked closely with the in-house tech team to help bridge the gap between the product and the website. More recently I spent 14 months with Formula Recruitment, working as a Tecnical Consultant recruiting Mid-Tech Lead Software Engineering roles for a number of high-level clients such as: Chainalysis, M&S, MoD, DEFRA and more. My main verticals were Java, Scala, SDETs with some work on JS & React roles.

- A link to some on-line evidence (blogs, videos, articles, etc.) -->

#### Logistics

My main passion is problem solving, which is reflected within my professional life. During my time with Music Gateway we often received ideas from our CEO for new features for the platform, and it was my responsibility to plan, implement and excute these features from the ground up. This would involve working across a number of internal teams including our inhouse Tech Team. I take pride in my ability to break down complex issues into more granular elements, and find a path to achieve what initially seems overwhelming. Notable examples of this in my previous career include during my time as a Technical Recruiter, where we would have to disect and abstract briefs from our clients on their hiring needs and turn those into fully realises roles, of which we would then actively headhunt.

<!-- Analytical mind, problem solving, use veg box as example (100% growth) -->

#### Teamwork

I'm a team oriented, natural leader and pride myself not only on my technical ability but my genuine passion for Agile, teamwork and facilitating others. When working in teams I've often received compliments on my confidence, technical knowledge and friendly, outgoing personality. During group projects with Makers I often led the stand ups, retros, and even on one occasion I was asked to lead the Cohort wide presentation of our first Engineering Project. What I've found incredible about my first year within the Software Engineering world is how much more can be achieved whilst working alongside other talented developers, versus solo work. It really had become one of my favourite elements of the role, and I relish in the opportunity to collaborate whenever possible. During my time with Music Gateway, I was given a leadership role at the age of 21, running a team of 4 people who all directly reported to me for the A&R arm of the business
<!-- listener, calming, funny, easy going use edventure MSc or vegbox as example 
able to bring up conflicting personalities in a healthy and productive way?-->

#### Communication

<!-- writing, clear, honest, lay groundwork, use Jellied Eel or MSx thesis as example? -->
